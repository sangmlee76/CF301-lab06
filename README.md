# LAB06 - 09: 

## Node, npm, and Express
Today, you will begin building an API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer Application, allowing a user to search for a location, present a Map, as well as interesting information about the area, all using data from APIs that your server will fetch and manage.

In labs 6 through 9, you will be building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. You will request data from a total of six third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. In labs 8 and 9, you will be persisting data in a SQL database.
